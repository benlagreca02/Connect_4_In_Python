Connect 4 in the terminal with a list in a list as a "grid"
This is just a simple project my robotics mentor tasked me with

I am still working on the Diagonal Win checking, and still need to clean up the dropping logic

P.S.
Dont look at it too long you might get a headache I am a new programmer and aren't that good :)
